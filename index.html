                <p>At Tuesday’s debate, Kamala Harris, the vice president, will try to promote herself as a change candidate without criticizing President Biden,
                 whom she has served for years.</p>

                <h3>Debate Details</h3>
                <p>
                    Vice President Kamala Harris will try to use her debate on Tuesday against 
                    former President Donald J. Trump to argue that Americans are ready to turn 
                    the page on the politics of the past decade, with its turmoil and social animus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Mr. Trump, standing just feet away, is likely to make a different case: 
                    He is expected to try to paint Ms. Harris, the sitting vice president, as 
                    the candidate of the status quo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The debate will pose a challenge for Ms. Harris, who will have to decide how much to embrace or distance 
                    herself from President Biden and his policies at 
                    a moment when polls show that many Americans are hungry for change. It is a conundrum other vice presidents have 
                    faced while seeking the presidency, and Ms. Harris’s allies said she would have to tread carefully as she makes a case for herself.
                </p>
                <p>“She can praise Biden and talk about the accomplishments, but also acknowledge that the work is not done,” said Bakari Sellers, an ally 
                    of Ms. Harris and a Democratic political commentator. “So she has to be willing 
                    to display to the American people a level of empathy and understanding, and not simply say everything we did was God’s gift to politics.”
